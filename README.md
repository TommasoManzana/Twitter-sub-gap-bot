# Twitter-sub-gap-bot

My first Twitter bot written in python, I still have **a lot** to learn about this language. Anyway I managed to use Youtube and Twitter API's to get a basic output.

- It retrieves data from Youtube
- checks if the subgap between Pewdiepie and Tseries is less than x
- if so it tweets out the result

A possible Output:
```
ಠ_ಠ Sub count bot here ಠ_ಠ
The sub gap is below 45,000! (44,513 subs)
@pewdiepie has 87,451,422 subscribers
@TSeries has 87,406,909 subscribers
```
